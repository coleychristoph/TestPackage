This Rmarkdown file will make a graph of the MaxTemp data. The code below is 
tabbed so that it properly knits to the webpage. Make sure you remove the eval=FALSE!!

```{r}
library(TestPackage)   # load TestPackage, which includes MaxTemp data frame.
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(MaxTemp, aes(x=Date, y=MaxTemp)) +
  geom_line()
```
  
We see that the daily max temperature in Flagstaff varies quite a lot.
